This section contains articles related to Mobile Hybrid Applications Development using frameworks such as Apache Cordova, Ionic Framework, React Native, QT and Fuse Tools.

Technically the last 3 shouldn't be considered Hybrid Applications as they don't follow the same logic as tools based on html and javascript mounted over a webview, the last 3 frameworks are actually to design and develop Native Apps with lenguages other than Java (Android) or Swift (iOS), this apps eventhough they may be built using JavaScript or C++ are then compiled into Native code. They all work on the idea of Write Once - Compile Everywhere.
